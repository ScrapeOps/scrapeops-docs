# ScrapeOps Scrapy SDK
To use the ScrapeOps SDK you need to install the SDK:

```
pip install scrapeops_scrapy
```

## Setup the SDK in Scrapy Project

In the `settings.py` file withing your Scrapy Project, you need to do the following steps:

#### #1 Add in the ScrapeOps extension:

```python
EXTENSIONS = {
    'scrapeops_scrapy.extension.ScrapeOpsMonitor': 500, 
}
```

#### #2 Enable the ScrapeOps stats middleware:
To get the most accurate stats, you need to add in the ScrapeOps retry middleware into the `DOWNLOADER_MIDDLEWARES` dictionary and disable the default Scrapy Retry middleware by setting its value to `None`:

```python
DOWNLOADER_MIDDLEWARES = {
    'scrapeops_scrapy.middleware.retry.RetryMiddleware': 550,
    'scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.retry.RetryMiddleware': None,
}
```

#### #3 Set Your ScrapeOps API Key:
Set your ScrapeOps API key so your logs can be linked to your account:

```python
SCRAPEOPS_API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
```


#### #4 Exclude Settings From Being Logged By ScrapeOps SDK:
The ScrapeOps SDK will log the settings used for each particular scrape. It won't log any settings that contain the following substrings:

- `API_KEY`
- `APIKEY`
- `SECRET_KEY`
- `SECRETKEY`

However, it can still log other settings that don't match these patterns. You can specify which settings not to log by adding the setting to the `SCRAPEOPS_SETTINGS_EXCLUSION_LIST`. 

```python
SCRAPEOPS_SETTINGS_EXCLUSION_LIST = [
    'NAME_OF_SETTING_NOT_TO_LOG'
]
```
